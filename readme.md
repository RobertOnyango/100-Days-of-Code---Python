## 100 Days of Code – Python 🐍

A personal challenge to practice Python every day for 100 days, building strong foundations for cybersecurity, cloud engineering, automation, and scripting.

This repository contains all my daily progress, exercises, notes, and projects as I advance through the challenge.

### 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- Strengthen Python fundamentals

- Build automation/scripting skills for cybersecurity

- Prepare for malware analysis (C → Assembly path)

- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

- Build a habit of consistent coding

- Document real growth publicly


### Each folder contains:

- The code for the day

- Notes or reflections under a notes.py file (when applicable)

- Mini-projects and/or exercises

### 🔥 Current Progress

- Day: 27 / 100

- Status: Actively updating daily

- Focus: Python basics → functions → loops → files → error handling → OOP → APIs → automation

- I push my work consistently to this repository to keep myself accountable.

### 🧠 What I’m Learning Throughout the Challenge

- Python fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, classes)

- Data structures & algorithms

- File handling & automation

- Working with APIs

- Error handling

- Object-oriented programming

- Scripting for cybersecurity

- Projects to build confidence

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3

- VS Code / PyCharm

- Git & GitHub

- PowerShell & Bash (for scripting practice)

### 🌱 End Goal After 100 Days

- Build a strong Python foundation for cybersecurity

- Create solid portfolio projects

- Start writing Python for automation, SOC tasks, and cloud engineering workflows

- Transition smoothly into C and assembly for malware analysis

- Improve coding discipline and problem-solving confidence
